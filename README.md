# SP500_Classfication_Models

The financial market is constantly evolving, it is a complex system consists of many non-linear relationships and interactive effects.

In this project I will go over multiple classification algorithms in an attempt to forecast the market. Specifically, SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (SPY) is picked as a convenient way to analyze the S&P 500. Many other related datasets will also be used, such as sector ETFs, foreign exchange rates, commodity futures, and economic data.

A big focus on this project will also feature selection. I want to use this project to gain some hands-on experience on implementing different feature selection methods and learn how to apply them optimally.

I will also cover areas such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, hyper-parameter optimization, and model selection.
